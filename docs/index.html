		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
		I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Bristol, researching AI ethics. 
		Residing in the intersection of AI and philosophy, my main research interests lie in the implementation of normative ethics in multiagent systems.
		I graduated with a B.A. in Philosophy from the University of Sheffield in 2018. 
		During this time, my growing interest in AI ethics sparked a personal research project into how I could contribute skills learnt during my undergraduate degree to the field.
		This lead me to the Computer Science (conversion) M.Sc. at the University of Bristol, where I undertook a project related to the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3535850.3536118">application of philosophical principles to multiple user social dilemmas</a>.
		My research continues in this direction, as Ph.D. student at the University of Bristol under the supervision of 
		<a href="https://niravajmeri.github.io/">Dr. Nirav Ajmeri</a> and 
		<a href="https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/paul-marshall">Dr. Paul Marshall</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		Currently, I am helping to organise a seminar series on <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ccais-seminar/home?authuser=0">Citizen-Centric AI Systems</a>, where we come together to discuss the role and challenges of citizen-centric AI. Sign up to the mailing list or submit a talk proposal <a href="http://eepurl.com/ivv9W2">here</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		I am also an organiser of <a href="https://dataethicsclub.com/index.html">Data Ethics Club</a>, a "journal" club about doing data science ethically. Sign up to <a href="https://dataethicsclub.com/mailing-list.html">the mailing list</a> and <a href="https://dataethicsclub.com/write_ups/write-ups.html">read our write ups</a>.
