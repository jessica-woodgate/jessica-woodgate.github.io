						Current Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Bristol. Passionate about the impact of technology on society, I believe research is the best way to make meaningful contributions to this area. My research interests are in AI Ethics and Normative Multiagent Systems, specifically how ethical principles can be applied to reasoning capacities used to resolve multiple-user social dilemmas that occur in  Sociotechnical Systems (STS) in satisfactory ways.</p>
