						Current Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Bristol. Passionate about the impact of technology on society, I believe research is the best way to make meaningful contributions to this area. My background in Philosophy and Computer Science equips me with skills appropriate for investigating AI ethics. I enjoy challenging myself and learning new skills in exciting research directions.</p>
					
					<h2>Research Interests</h2>
					<p>AI Ethics and Normative Multiagent Systems, specifically how ethical principles can be applied to reasoning capacities used to resolve multiple-user social dilemmas that occur in  Sociotechnical Systems (STS) in satisfactory ways. Exploring the development of consistent methodologies that practitioners can use in the governance of STS to promote the overarching goal of fairness.</p>
