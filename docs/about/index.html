			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Residing in the intersection of AI and philosophy, my main research interests lie in the implementation of normative ethics in multiagent systems.
			I graduated with a B.A. in Philosophy from the University of Sheffield in 2018. 
			During this time, my growing interest in AI ethics sparked a personal research project into how I could contribute skills learnt during my undergraduate degree to the field.
			This lead me to the Computer Science (conversion) M.Sc. at the University of Bristol, where I undertook a project related to the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3535850.3536118">application of philosophical principles to multiple user social dilemmas</a>.
			My research continues in this direction, as Ph.D. student at the University of Bristol under the supervision of 
			<a href="https://niravajmeri.github.io/">Dr. Nirav Ajmeri</a> and 
			<a href="https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/paul-marshall">Dr. Paul Marshall</a>.
